## a3a
a3a.cpp is a program that will automatically generate the correct parity bits
for any input string. The input string will be the first argument of the program.
Your program, called a3a, should write the parity bits in the correct order to stdout
(e.g. cout or print) as characters, ”0” or ”1”.

example:
### ./a3a ab

yields the parity bits
### 01011
